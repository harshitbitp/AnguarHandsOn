# AnguarHandsOn
This repository contains solutions of hands-on of Angular (Stage 3). 
I have completed all my hands-on of angular till day 4. 
There are two folders. First folder contains complete hands-on of Day 1 and second folder contains complete hands-on of day 2,3 and 4 combined.
In second folder that contains combined hands-on of days 2,3 and 4; there will be one login form whose username is = admin and password is = password.
Use ng serve to view the working.
